# processschedulersimulator
A program that simulates a simple version of the process scheduling system in the computer processor. The program will read a set of process information from an input file (processList.txt) and schedule their execution order using a Queue data structure. Every process in the file has an ID(on the left) and a required time of execution (in ms on the right).
